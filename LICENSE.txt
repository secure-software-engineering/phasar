SQLite
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public do
main by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies the
y work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public
 domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at th
e main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile,
 sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as
 a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any m
eans.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQL
ite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with 
a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for examp
le the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-s
ource licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliver
able SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts
 should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite lib
rary.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code ha
s been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code 
can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public
 domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontamin
ated with licensed code from other projects.
