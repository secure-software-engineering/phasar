+ Philipp Dominik Schubert (philipp.schubert@upb.de) and others
+ Please also refer to https://phasar.org/

Required version of the C++ standard
------------------------------------
PhASAR requires C++-17.

Currently supported version of LLVM
-----------------------------------
PhASAR is currently set up to support LLVM-14.0.

What is PhASAR?
---------------
PhASAR is a LLVM-based static analysis framework written in C++. It allows users
to specify arbitrary data-flow problems which are then solved in a
fully-automated manner on the specified LLVM IR target code. Computing points-to
information, call-graph(s), etc. is done by the framework, thus you can focus on
what matters.

How do I get started with PhASAR?
---------------------------------
We have some documentation on PhASAR in our [_**wiki**_](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/phasar/wiki). You probably would like to read
this README first and then have a look on the material provided on https://phasar.org/
as well. Please also have a look on PhASAR's project directory and notice the project directory
examples/ as well as the custom tool tools/myphasartool.cpp.

Building PhASAR
---------------
If you cannot work with one of the pre-built versions of PhASAR and would like to
compile PhASAR yourself, then please check the wiki for installing the
prerequisites and compilation. It is recommended to compile PhASAR yourself in
order to get the full C++ experience and to have full control over the build
mode.

As a shortcut for the very first PhASAR build on your system, you can use our [bootstrap](./bootstrap.sh) script:

```bash
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```

Note: If you want to do changes within PhASAR, it is recommended to build it in Debug mode:
```bash
$ ./bootstrap.sh -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

The bootstrap script may ask for superuser permissions (to install the dependencies); however it is not recommended to start the whole script with `sudo`.

For subsequent builds, see [Compiling PhASAR](#compiling-phasar-if-not-already-done-using-the-installation-scripts).

Please help us to improve PhASAR
--------------------------------
You are using PhASAR and would like to help us in the future? Then please
support us by filling out this [web form](https://goo.gl/forms/YG6m3M7sxeUJmKyi1).

By giving us feedback you help to decide in what direction PhASAR should stride in
the future and give us clues about our user base. Thank you very much!


Installation
------------
PhASAR can be installed using the installer scripts as explained in the following.


### Installing PhASAR on an Ubuntu system
In the following, we would like to give an complete example of how to install
PhASAR using an Ubuntu or Unix-like system.

Therefore, we provide an installation script. To install PhASAR, just navigate to the top-level
directory of PhASAR and use the following command:
```bash
$ ./bootstrap.sh --install
```

The bootstrap script may ask for superuser permissions.

Done!


### Installing PhASAR a MacOS system
Due to unfortunate updates to MacOS and the handling of C++, especially on the newer M1 processors, we can't support native development on Mac.
The easiest solution to develop PhASAR on a Mac right now is to use [dockers development environments](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dev-environments/). Clone this repository as described in their documentation. Afterwards, you have to login once manually, as a root user by running `docker exec -it -u root <container name> /bin/bash` to complete the rest of the install process as described in this readme (install submodules, run bootstrap.sh, ...).
Now you can just attach your docker container to VS Code or any other IDE, which supports remote development.

### Compiling PhASAR (if not already done using the installation scripts)
Set the system's variables for the C and C++ compiler to clang:
```
$ export CC=/usr/local/bin/clang
$ export CXX=/usr/local/bin/clang++
```
You may need to adjust the paths according to your system. When you cloned PhASAR from Github you need to initialize PhASAR's submodules before building it:

```
$ git submodule update --init
```

If you downloaded PhASAR as a compressed release (e.g. .zip or .tar.gz) you can use the `init-submodules-release.sh` script that manually clones the required submodules:

```
$ utils/init-submodules-release.sh
```

Navigate into the PhASAR directory. The following commands will do the job and compile the PhASAR framework:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ ninja -j $(nproc) # or use a different number of cores to compile it
$ sudo ninja install # only if you wish to install PhASAR system wide
```

When you have used the `bootstrap.sh` script to install PhASAR, the above steps are already done.
Use them as a reference if you wish to modify PhASAR and recompile it.

After compilation using cmake the following two binaries can be found in the build/ directory:

+ phasar-llvm - the actual PhASAR command-line tool
+ myphasartool - an example tool that shows how tools can be build on top of PhASAR

Use the command:

`$ ./phasar-llvm --help`

in order to display the manual and help message.

Please be careful and check if errors occur during the compilation.

When using CMake to compile PhASAR the following optional parameters can be used:

| Parameter : Type|  Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| <b>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS</b> : BOOL | Build shared libraries (default is ON) |
| <b>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</b> : STRING | Build PhASAR in 'Debug', 'RelWithDebInfo' or 'Release' mode <br> (default is 'Debug') |
| <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> : PATH | Path where PhASAR will be installed if <br> “ninja install” is invoked or the “install” <br> target is built (default is /usr/local/phasar) |
| <b>PHASAR_BUILD_DOC</b> : BOOL | Build PhASAR documentation (default is OFF) |
| <b>PHASAR_BUILD_UNITTESTS</b> : BOOL | Build PhASAR unit tests (default is ON) |
| <b>PHASAR_BUILD_IR</b> : BOOL | Build PhASAR IR (required for running the unit tests) (default is ON) |
| <b>PHASAR_BUILD_OPENSSL_TS_UNITTESTS</b> : BOOL | Build PhASAR unit tests that require OpenSSL (default is OFF) |
| <b>PHASAR_ENABLE_PAMM</b> : STRING | Enable the performance measurement mechanism <br> ('Off', 'Core' or 'Full', default is Off) |
| <b>PHASAR_ENABLE_PIC</b> : BOOL | Build Position-Independed Code (default is ON) |
| <b>PHASAR_ENABLE_WARNINGS</b> : BOOL | Enable compiler warnings (default is ON) |

You can use these parameters either directly or modify the installer-script `bootstrap.sh`

#### A remark on compile time
C++'s long compile times are always a pain. As shown in the above, when using cmake the compilation can easily be run in parallel, resulting in shorter compilation times. Make use of it!


### Running a test solver
To test if everything works as expected please run the following command:

`$ phasar-llvm --module test/build_systems_tests/installation_tests/module.ll -D ifds-solvertest`

If you obtain output other than a segmentation fault or an exception terminating the program abnormally everything works as expected.

How to use PhASAR?
